# copy-file
## AIM:
To write a python program for copying the contents from one file to another file.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Open the source file in read mode.

## Step 2:
Read the contents of the source file and store it in a variable

## Step 3:
Close the source file.

## Step 4:
Open the destination file in write mode. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

## Step 5:
Write the contents from the variable to the destination file.

## Step 6:
Read the contents of the destination file and print it to verify the copy operation.

## Step 7:
End the program

## PROGRAM:

 def copy(fname, newfile):

   with open(fname, 'r')as fp:

      with open(newfile, 'w') as fp1:

         data1=fp.read()

         fp1.write(data1)

 fname=input("Enter an existing file: ")

 newfile=input("Enter a name for new file: ")

 copy(fname,Â newfile)
